/** Bitrate of the video.

 Sets the video bitrate (Kbps). Refer to the table below and set your bitrate. If the bitrate you set is beyond the proper range, the SDK automatically adjusts it to a value within the range. You can also choose from the following options:

 - AgoraVideoBitrateStandard: (Recommended) The standard bitrate mode. In this mode, the bitrates differ between the live broadcast and communication profiles:

     - Communication profile: The video bitrate is the same as the base bitrate.
     - Live broadcast profile: The video bitrate is twice the base bitrate.

 - AgoraVideoBitrateCompatible: The compatible bitrate mode. In this mode, the bitrate stays the same regardless of the profile. In a live broadcast profile, if you choose this mode, the video frame rate may be lower than the set value.

Agora uses different video codecs for different profiles to optimize the user experience. For example, a communication profile prioritizes the smoothness while a live broadcast profile prioritizes the video quality (a higher bitrate). Therefore, Agora recommends setting this parameter as AgoraVideoBitrateStandard.
