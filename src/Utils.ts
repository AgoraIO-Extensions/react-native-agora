/**
 * In certain systems or contexts, the maximum value of an unsigned integer can be used to represent a specific value in signed integers.
 * This is due to the two's complement representation of signed integers in binary.
 * When interpreted as an unsigned integer, the binary representation of this specific signed integer corresponds to the maximum value of the unsigned integer.
 * Therefore, when dealing with values from such systems or contexts, we need to convert this maximum value to the corresponding signed integer value for correct interpretation.
 * for example, 18446744073709551615 can be -1.
