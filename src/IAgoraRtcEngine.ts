Dual streams are a pairing of a high-quality video stream and a low-quality video stream:High-quality video stream: High bitrate, high resolution.Low-quality video stream: Low bitrate, low resolution.After you enable dual-stream mode, you can call setRemoteVideoStreamType to choose to receive either the high-quality video stream or the low-quality video stream on the subscriber side.This method is applicable to all types of streams from the sender, including but not limited to video streams collected from cameras, screen sharing streams, and custom-collected video streams.If you need to enable dual video streams in a multi-channel scenario, you can call the enableDualStreamModeEx method.You can call this method either before or after joining a channel.
