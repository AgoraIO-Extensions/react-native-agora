   * - On the iOS platform, the original resolution of the remote video must not exceed 640 × 480 pixels.

   *
   * @note
   * - You can call this method either before or after joining a channel.
   * - Do not set the `profile` parameter of `setAudioProfile` to `SpeechStandard(1)`; otherwise, this method call does not take effect.

   *   - `setLocalVoiceEqualization`
   *   - `setLocalVoiceReverb`
   *   - `setVoiceConversionPreset`
   * @param preset The options for SDK preset voice beautifier effects:
   *               - `SingingBeautifier`: Singing beautifier effect.
   * @param param1 The gender characteristics options for the singing voice:
   *               - `1`: A male-sounding voice.
   *               - `2`: A female-sounding voice.
   * @param param2 The reverberation effects options:
   *               - `1`: The reverberation effect sounds like singing in a small room.
   *               - `2`: The reverberation effect sounds like singing in a large room.
   *               - `3`: The reverberation effect sounds like singing in a hall.
