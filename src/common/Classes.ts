   *
   * If the aspect ratio is different between `dimensions` and the screen, the SDK adjusts the video encoding resolution according to the
   * following rules (using an example value for `dimensions` of 1280 Ã— 720):
   * - When the width and height of the screen are both lower than those of `dimensions`, the SDK uses the resolution of the screen for video encoding.
   * For example, if the screen is 640 Ã— 360, the SDK uses 640 Ã— 360 for video encoding.
   * - When either the width or height of the screen is higher than that of `dimension`, the SDK uses the maximum values that do not exceed those of `dimensions`
   * while maintaining the aspect ratio of the screen for video encoding. For example, if the screen is 2000 Ã— 1500, the SDK uses 960 Ã— 720 for video encoding.
   *
   * **Note**
   * - The billing of the screen sharing stream is based on the value of `dimensions`.
   * When you do not pass in a value, Agora bills you at 1280 Ã— 720; when you pass a value in,
   * Agora bills you at that value. For details, see [Pricing for Real-time Communication](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/billing_rtc?platform=React%20Native).
   * - This value does not indicate the orientation mode of the output ratio. For how to set the video orientation, see [`VideoOutputOrientationMode`]{@link VideoOutputOrientationMode}.
   * - Whether the SDK can support a resolution at 720P depends on the performance of the device. If you set 720P but the device cannot support it, the video frame rate can be lower.
